# Synchronous Roomba Playback
I added to this project as part of the Creative Inquiry Project on Coordinated Control of Swarm Robotics using RaspberryPi-controlled Roombas.
    (with specific applications to Pulse Coupled Oscillators).
    
My addition was finding a way for the Roombas to play synchronously, allowing for songs with multiple parts to be played. To test this I programmed a vocal compostion from my choir class that semester.
